```typescript
import { addHooks, getComponents } from '@mutates/react';
import { createProject, createSourceFile, saveProject } from '@mutates/core';

// Initialize a new React project
createProject();

// Add a React component file to the project
createSourceFile(
  'App.tsx',
  `
  import React from 'react';

  const App: React.FC = () => {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
  };

  export default App;
`,
);

// Perform some React-specific transformations
addHooks(getComponents('App.tsx').at(0)!, ['useEffect']);

// Save the modified file
saveProject();
```
