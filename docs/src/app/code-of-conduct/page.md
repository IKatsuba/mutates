---

As a community of developers, we strive to create a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for
all, regardless of experience level, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit
  permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are
expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable
behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is
representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting
the project team at [igor@katsuba.dev](mailto:igor@katsuba.dev) . All complaints will be reviewed
and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
circumstances.
